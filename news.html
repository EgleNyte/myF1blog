                        "I'm leaving for now," he told me as we chatted outside the Alfa Romeo hospitality unit.
                        "I posted my first picture in a F1 car when I was three years old on my social media.
                        The last picture [in F1] is not this year.
                        We saw already many drivers have stopped for one year and come back, like Esteban Ocon and Alex Albon."<br><br>

                        "On my side, I had two years reserve driving for Ferrari in 2017 and 2018 and finally got my chance in 2019.
                        You never know what will happen in F1.
                        For now, I want to say thanks to all the people who have supported me in the last three years,
                        to all the fans who supported me after the news, and to all the drivers here in F1 who texted me.
                        It's been a great three years."

                        this year, as they exchanged presents in the not-particularly-seasonal climes of Abu Dhabi.

                        Paddle racquets seemed to be the in vogue present this season, with both Esteban Ocon and Pierre
                        Gasly being treated to them by their Secret Santas.<br><br>

                    <h4>REVEALED: F1's team bosses choose their Top 10 drivers of 2021</h4>
                    <h6>Max Verstappen pipped Lewis Hamilton to the 2021 World Championship to claim his first F1 crown - and he has now picked
                        up another accolade, as F1's team principals voted the Red Bull racer their number one driver of the year in
                        our annual poll...<br>
                        We asked all 10 team bosses to submit their list of the top 10 drivers of the year, under the proviso
                        that their individual ranking would remain anonymous.
                        Drivers were awarded scores based on the current F1 points system -
                        25 for the top driver down to one for 10th in each list. Those scores were combined to create a ranking.<br>
                        And after clinching his first world title, with a record 18 podiums that included 10 victories,
                        Verstappen has come out on top for the first time, edging out last year's winner Hamilton by 21 points.

                    <h4>TECH TUESDAY: How Red Bull and Honda cleverly transformed 2020's RB16 into the title-winning RB16B</h4>
                    <h6>Max Verstappen became the first Red Bull world champion for eight years with his dramatic and
                        controversial victory in the Abu Dhabi season finale.

                        Aside from Verstappen's personal performances, it was the culmination of years of development from both the
                        team and their power unit partner Honda. Together they have steadily eroded the previously dominant performance
                        advantage of the Mercedes team.

                        They have done so with a car - the RB16B - which has remained true to the team's long-established high-rake
                        aerodynamic concept. This was an extremely effective development of last season's RB16 given the regulatory
                        freeze restrictions put on everyone for 2021, announced last year in response to the economic challenges of
                        the pandemic.

                    <h4>PALMER: Whatever you thought of the Abu Dhabi outcome, Verstappen was a worthy champion in 2021</h4>
                    <h6>The dramatic late Safety Car in Abu Dhabi ended up deciding the championship, and the manner it was
                        brought in has sparked much debate and controversy at the end of a highly dramatic season.

                        On the one hand we had the mouth-watering finale that Formula 1 has likely never seen before - the
                        championship being decided with two drivers battling for Grand Prix victory on the final lap of the
                        season, with the winner being crowned champion. All of this including a brilliant bout of wheel-to-wheel
                        scrapping lasting a third of a lap, with the cars separated by paper widths on a few occasions.
